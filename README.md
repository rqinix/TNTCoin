### Gift Goal

The Gift Goal System in TNT Coin allows you to set specific gift targets for your live stream.

- Choose from available gifts with emojis, set the desired target count, and toggle the display on or off as needed.

### Randomized Block Placement

- This feature allows players to place a random block from a predefined list whenever they use a specific item in the game.
- Update the `RANDOM_BLOCK_ITEM` to the desired item ID.
- Modify the `BLOCKS` array from `scripts/config/tiktok.js` file to include any block IDs you want to be randomly selected when the specified `RANDOM_BLOCK_ITEM` is used.

```ts
/**
¬†* The item that will be used to place random block.
¬†*/
config.setConfig("RANDOM_BLOCK_ITEM", "minecraft:amethyst_block");

/**
 * List of possible blocks when placing random blocks.
 */
config.setConfig("BLOCKS", [
    "minecraft:pink_wool",
    "minecraft:magenta_wool",
    "minecraft:orange_wool",
    "minecraft:lime_wool",
    "minecraft:yellow_wool",
]);
```

## Adding Custom Sounds

To add custom sounds, ensure your files are in `.ogg` format and place them in your **resource pack** in your desired directory (e.g., `sounds/meme/`). Then, define them in the `sounds/sound_definitions.json` file.

Below is an example of how to structure your custom sounds:

```json
{

  "vine_boom": {
      "category": "meme",
      "sounds": ["sounds/meme/vine_boom"]
  },

  "your_custom_sound": {
      "sounds": ["path/to/your/sound"]
  }

}
```

## Overlay

Replace the `overlay.png` file located at `TNTCoinRP/textures/tnt-coin/overlay.png` with your own custom overlay image. Ensure they still have the same file name `overlay`.

```
tnt-coin/
‚î£ gui/
‚îÉ ‚îó buttons/
‚î£ items/
‚î£ particles/
‚îó overlay.png
```
